There's nothing to see here - God is a farce, and a terrifying farce at that - one that has brought mankind to its absolute deepest pit of apocalyptic destruction in the name of falsehoods that limit Man's ability to live. He knew the Golden Rule to be true, but was it <i>really</i> divinely ordained by the great Founding Fathers through Providence, or simply a good moral compass to hold? The answer, of course, was the latter. Even then, the lack of a true punishment for everything he's done, and in fact the rewards brought on by his sins made him realize that maybe Languedoc had a point about these cunts in robes and quaint little churches. No God can take away the freedoms and harmonies of Mankind, and it was high time to realize that.<br>A one-term President, Liam was quickly disgraced by his coalition and his Vice-President over this radical political-religious transformation, one that alienated him from most factions and interest groups. Still, Liam governed competently. He saw pragmatic leadership focused on reforming Languedoc's positions but largely keeping his paradigm policies.
